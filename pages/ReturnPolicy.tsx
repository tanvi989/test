        <li>
          You are entitled to a full refund, including shipping (if charged),
          within 30 days of delivery, for any reason.

        <li>
          Refunds will be issued to your original payment method within 5–10

        </li>
        <li>
          Products must be returned in their original condition (undamaged
          frames and lenses). Reasonable wear from trying the product is
          acceptable.

        2. REPLACEMENTS – WE KEEP IT EASY
      </h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>
          If you’re not fully satisfied with your glasses – for any reason –
          we’ll happily replace or adjust them, at no extra cost.
        </li>
        <li>
          This applies even after you’ve tried the glasses, as we want you to
          find your perfect fit.
        </li>
        <li>
          You may request a replacement for a different frame, lens adjustment,
          or prescription correction.
        </li>
        <li>
          There is no set limit to how many adjustments or replacements we’ll
          provide, but we do reserve the right to refuse requests that appear to
          be excessive, abusive, or fraudulent.
        </li>
        <li>
          Replacement shipping is free in most cases; customs duties (for
          non-UK customers) may still apply.

        3. ORDER CANCELLATIONS
      </h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>
          You may cancel your order at any time before it is shipped and
          receive a full refund.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once an order has shipped, it cannot be cancelled. Instead, you may
          request a refund or replacement under Sections 1 or 2 above.
        </li>
        <li>
          Orders are considered “shipped” once a tracking number has been
          generated or the package is in the possession of a carrier.

      </h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>
          While we are happy to offer generous replacements and adjustments, we
          reserve the right to deny requests that indicate misuse or repeated,
          unreasonable returns (e.g., deliberate damage, repeated exchanges for
          resale).
        </li>
        <li>
          This helps us keep our policies fair for all customers while still
          offering industry-leading flexibility.
        </li>
        <li>
          Our decision on refunds, replacements, or cancellations will be
          final, but we will always act in good faith.

        By placing an order, you agree that US federal and state consumer
        statutes do not apply, as this is a cross-border purchase from the UK.
